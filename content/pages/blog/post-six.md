Everyone knows Coogi. Not many people are as keen on CUGGI. CUGGI was from 1966-1986. Originally designed to sound aboriginal. It was the original brand name of Coogi and lasted until.

The label looked like this.

There was a transition where both Cuggi and Coogi were both on the label.

Generally the patterning was relatively more basic and consisted of geometric styles. Assume that perhaps there was a loom or design change.

Some Cuggi patterns remained in production when moving to Coogi. Angry snake for instance.
